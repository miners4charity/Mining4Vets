## About Us:
The Cryptocurrency that we mine is called Monero. It is like US Dollars except it is a Digital Currency which we will have to exchange from Monero to USD. Just like when you exchange Canadian Money for US Money.

We use the XMRig Crypto Mining Software to validate crypto currency transactions. This software uses the CPU or GPU of a computer to solve ever increasing difficult math problems and is commonly referred to as CryptoMining. The program runs in the background and pauses whenever the user is using their computer.

We will be donating to the following Veterans Charities:

- Wounded Warrior Project: https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/
- Freedom Service Dogs of America: https://freedomservicedogs.org/
- Gary Sinise Foundation: https://www.garysinisefoundation.org/
- Operation Second Chance: https://operationsecondchance.org/

## FAQs

### What is CryptoMining?

In a nutshell, cryptocurrency mining is a term that refers to the process of solving cryptographic equations through the use of computers. This process involves validating data blocks and adding transaction records to a public record (ledger) known as a blockchain. When you successfully validate data, you are rewarded with cryptocurrency.

Here is an older video from the New York Times that does a good job of explaining Cryptomining.

### Where does the money come from?/How does the money appear?

Think of it like this... What happens when you mine for Gold? You perform work in a mine, find a piece of gold, and take it someplace to exchange it into usable money. That is basically what is happening. Just with your computer, when the computer is not being used by you.

### What is Monero?

Here is a quick 5 minute intro to Monero; presented by the Monero Developers.

### Will I be taxed?

Bottom line, No *you* will not be taxed. 
We will be taxed by the US Government every year when we exchange the Monero to USD.

### Why should I download and run the software?

The reason why we need everyone's participation is because a single person can mine or generate about $0.05 a day. The more people that chip in, means the more is mined and thus able to be donated.
